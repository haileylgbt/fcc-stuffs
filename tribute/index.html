        <p>John Horton Conway was one of the greatest mathematicians of his time. He was known for his study of symmetries, sphere packings, lattices, polyhedra and tilings. But of course, nothing that he did even came close to helping him rise in popularity than The Game of Life, or just simply Life. Life is a celluar automata where cells on a conceptually infinite grid live and die based on certain rules. John Conway will always be remembered as someone who revolutionized the way we look at simulations and just maths in general.</p>
